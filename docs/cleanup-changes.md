# Cleanup Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document details the cleanup changes made to the Briefing-Buddy-UI codebase to improve maintainability and reduce bundle size without impacting functionality.

## Changes Applied

### Removed Unused Components
- Removed the `HomeComponent` which was not referenced or used anywhere in the application:
  - `/src/app/home/home.component.css`
  - `/src/app/home/home.component.html`
  - `/src/app/home/home.component.ts`

### Removed Duplicate/Backup Files
- Removed all `.fixed` and `.updated` files that were backups or modified versions of existing files:
  - Various component, service, and configuration files with `.fixed` or `.updated` extensions
  - These changes had already been incorporated into the main files

### Removed Temporary Documentation
- Removed development checklists, bug reports, and testing documents:
  - `todo.md`
  - `regression-testing-checklist.md`
  - `ui-verification-checklist.md`
  - `packaging-checklist.md`
  - `bug-report.md`
  - `cleanup-analysis-files.md`

### Removed Verification Files
- Removed UI verification files used for testing:
  - `/src/app/ui-verification.scss`

### Removed Package.json Fragments
- Removed environment scripts fragment:
  - `package.json.env-scripts`

## Pending Changes (Not Yet Applied)
The following changes were identified but not yet applied:

### Unused Dependencies
- FontAwesome packages
- Bootstrap and related packages
- These should be removed from package.json to reduce bundle size

### Redundant Navigation
- Placeholder routes for `/pending-approvals` and `/requests`
- These could be removed to simplify the UI

### Duplicate Assets
- Consider keeping only the SVG version of the Alberta logo for better scalability

## Regression Testing Results
- The application builds successfully after cleanup
- No errors were encountered during the build process
- A warning about unused polyfills.ts was noted but does not impact functionality

## Next Steps
1. Consider removing the unused dependencies from package.json
2. Review the placeholder routes in the navigation
3. Consider optimizing the logo assets
4. Address the polyfills.ts warning if desired
